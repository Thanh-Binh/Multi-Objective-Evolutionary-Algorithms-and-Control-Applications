I am very pleased to announce the new version of the Evolution Strategy
Toolbox for use with Matlab.

Evolution Strategy Toolbox is a powerful tool for scalar and multiobjective constrained optimization problems.

New Features:
  - Support for optimization subject to linear and nonlinear constraints
  (in terms of inequalities or equalities)
  - Search for a feasible region in which all given constraints are satisfied (without optimizing any objective)
  - Many evolutionary algorithms is available so that it is very easy to
   configure ES for each optimization task (that means, users can choose desired algorithms for mutation, recombination and selection or
set some important parameters of ES (population size, niche methods etc.))
  - Many demos are now available.
  - Many improvements by searching for global minima or feasible
trade-offs between conflict objectives; by updating population and
by dialogue with the obtained results.

and more ...more .. 


Requirement: Matlab 5.**



I am pleased to announce "Multiobjective Controller Design Toolbox"
for use with Matlab.

This toolbox provides many GUI for 
   - setting state-space matrice for a plant
   - choosing and configuring a controller (PI, PID, LQG, Loop Shaping Design Procedure (LSDP))
   - choosing design requirements (rise time, settling time, time to
peak, overshoot, steady state error, constraints on plant's inputs and
outputs or specific pole region) for each suitable plant's inputs
and outputs. Every design requirement can be formulated either in terms
of an objective or in terms of a constraint.
   - for choosing a pole region (hyperbolla, disc, mixed, etc.) 
   - automatically generating a suitable code for multiobjective optimization (M-file)

After formulating the design problem and converting it into optimization
task, this tool calls the multiobjective evolution strategy to solve the optimization task.
